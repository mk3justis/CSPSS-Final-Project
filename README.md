# CSPSS-Final-Project
Justis Nazirbage, Piash Islam, and Simon Chummar

This project allows users to load audio files, plot them on various plots and analyze the data of the file. 

The structure of the program follows a MVC architecture where:
model.py --> contains the logic and the data model
view.py --> uses tkinter to implement the GUI
controller.py --> connects the model and the view files and is the main controller
main.py --> runs or executes the application

Project Descrption: The goal of the project is to make a Scientific Python Interactive Data Acoustic Modeling platform which will analyze imported audio and clean the audio to aid in scientific computations.

Instructions: First import an audio file by clicking the load file button, which will covert the file into a .wave if it isn't in that format. Then by clicking Show plots, it will show the graphs of the data a long with the data in the GUI.
