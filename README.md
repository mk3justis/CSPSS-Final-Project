# CSPSS-Final-Project
Justis Nazirbage, Piash Islam, and Simon Chummar

This project allows users to load audio files, plot them on various plots and analyze the data of the file. 

The structure of the program follows a MVC architecture where:
model.py --> contains the logic and the data model
view.py --> uses tkinter to implement the GUI
controller.py --> connects the model and the view files and is the main controller
main.py --> runs or executes the application
