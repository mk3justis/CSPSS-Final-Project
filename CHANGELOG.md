We first started of creating our program directory CSPSS-Final-Project

We then created three branches for each of us

last week we added branches that were import_data. This branch was mainly to see if the github was working

S_starting was the start of our project with the MVC architecture 

Piash created the branch added the RT60 code and the functions and the buttons to combine the plots
